Considering the constraints we had, the outcome we have today is amazing. We couldn't have done it without the collective efforts of various committees, valued life members, external consultants, volunteers and donors. Thank you all for your patience, continuous support and trust in the ANMC team.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our initial strategy was to begin with temporary facilities and build further structures in several stages. In line with the approved planning permit proposal, we now aim to modify the existing structure and make it suitable for temporary temples and mediation halls.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We are organizing a Grand Gala Dinner and Live Music on 25th June. Like any other program, this event will have no meaning without the support from all of you. We request you to book the tickets for the event. Please try to bring as many people as possible from your area who haven't yet become a member of ANMC. We should encourage such individuals and families to become life members of ANMC during the Gala Dinner. Building a community centre is our collective responsibility and no one from our community should be left out of this noble cause.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Please click on the link below to reserve your seat as early as possible since we need to plan for the event based on the number of participants:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:buttons -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons\"><!-- wp:button -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://www.trybooking.com/events/landing/904785?fbclid=IwAR3mKkR3Q-Z9Nb3xJ7189pHSa58zoOCh_10edczYRDDVEQ0kLuBUiE6Pflc\">Book your tickets for the event</a></div>\n<!-- /wp:button --></div>\n<!-- /wp:buttons -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The entry fee for the event is $75 for each individual and children below 14 are not allowed.

In September 2025, ANMC leadership had an opportunity to present this project to Victorian government representatives. The Hon. Ingrid Stitt, Minister for Multicultural Affairs, along with local Members of Parliament Josh Bull and Kathleen Matthews-Ward, visited ANMC during the Indra Jatra festival. In a special meeting, ANMC’s President outlined the Centre’s achievements and the vision for the new Multicultural Hall. The response was extremely encouraging, the Minister praised the Nepali community’s dedication and committed to supporting ANMC’s work, while the MPs promised to assist in progressing the hall proposal. This high-profile visit and endorsement mark a major partnership with the Victorian Government, boosting our confidence that the ANMC Hall project will receive the collaboration and possibly future funding needed at the state level. ANMC also engaged with the opposition: the Deputy Opposition Leader (Shadow Minister for Multicultural Affairs) and other MPs and voiced bipartisan support for our initiatives. This multi-partisan goodwill is a positive sign as we move forward with planning and seeking resources for the Hall, which we envision as a landmark facility open to all communities.</p>",

The website, launching at the AGM, will enable registrations, payments, bookings, and secure member access. Community Safety: Funding also provides a defibrillator and updated first-aid equipment, with stations placed in key areas.
